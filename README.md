# Academind React Complete Guide 2023 Course section 29 summary dummy back end

To be used as a dummy backend for this front-end repo: https://github.com/BenRoss92/academind-react-complete-guide-2023-course-section-29-summary-front-end

Downloaded from here: https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/blob/zz-reactjs-summary-updated/extra-files/dummy-backend.zip

Made a small change to make it work, so that I could then use it for this lesson onwards of this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/35734752#overview
